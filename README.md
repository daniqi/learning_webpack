# Package.json

## Private
If you set "private": true in your package.json, then npm will refuse to publish it.  
This is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories.  

## Webpack commands
npm run webpack: compiles in readable format  
npm run test: runs a configtest  
npm run serve: run the webpack-dev-server  
npm run watch: run webpack and watch for file changes  


# Babel
Is a Javascript transpiler that is mainly used to convert ES6 code into plain old ES5 Javascript that can be run in any browser.

- Can I use Webpack in ES6 without using Babel?  
No unless all dependencies of your project supports ES6.  

In package.json add "type": "module" to use node option to use .mjs files.
